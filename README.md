# Education: Analyzing the Disproportionate Impacts of Remote Learning on Rich vs Poor States
## By: Landon Bragg and Ben Kim
## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic forced an unprecedented shift in education systems worldwide, leading to the widespread adoption of remote learning. This study investigates the impact of remote learning and the pandemic on studentsâ€™ education outcomes in rich vs. poor states. Using datasets comprising academic performance metrics before and after the pandemic, we analyze the effects on different demographics. Our goal is to inform policymakers, educators, and administrative staff about the challenges and opportunities presented by the transition to remote learning during the pandemic.

## About
We utilized five datasets for our analysis:

Learning Modalities (2020 and 2021): Distribution of remote, in-person, and hybrid schooling models within each state.
SAT Statistics (2020 and 2021): Quantitative SAT data across states.
Median Income: Income data for the top 20 states in terms of SAT participation.
Methodology
Data Preparation: We filtered and cleaned the datasets to focus on the top 20 states by SAT participation to minimize the impact of outliers.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculated proportions of different learning modalities and analyzed changes from 2020 to 2021.
Clustering Analysis: Used K-Means clustering to identify patterns in SAT scores and income levels.
Comparative Analysis: Compared changes in SAT scores between the richest and poorest states.
Key Findings
Learning Modalities: Significant shift from remote and hybrid learning to in-person learning from 2020 to 2021.
SAT Scores: Rich states saw an increase in SAT scores, while poorer states experienced a decrease.
Income and SAT Scores: Higher income states had better SAT performance, highlighting the inequitable impact of remote learning.
Conclusion
The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated educational inequalities. Students from poorer states faced greater challenges, resulting in lower SAT scores compared to their wealthier counterparts. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds and ensure equitable access to quality education.

## Future Work
Policy Recommendations: Develop strategies to support remote learning for students from low-income families.
Further Research: Investigate long-term impacts of remote learning on educational outcomes.
